# Real-Time-object-Detection
This is a school project:

on this project we used deep learning for predicting mnist digits. 
This app has two version! In the first version we classify images and user can drag and drop images and predict them. 
On version 2 user can classify digits by drawing them! 

## Clone the repository
Go to a folder of choice and open a terminal that can access git. Write "https://github.com/Legfi/object-detection-project.git".

Ofcoures you can use github desktop if you wish to clone the repository in a easier way.
## Create a conda environment
If conda is installed with the environment path variables then it should work with only printing. Else open the Anaconda navigator and open a terminal from there.

then type "conda create --name pythonenv python=3.9"
## Update environment with needed packages 
Browse to the git repo folder with the terminal. print "pip install -r requirements.txt"
## unzip models first if you want to use our models
navigate to model folder and unzip them. models were had big size which was the reason we decide to uppload them as zip file to be able to use github free version.

## Start the python script
Browse to the location of the files.
Then type "streamlit run streamlit_apps/streamlit_final.py" When the script is started the default browser will open at localhost:8501 if it doesn't. Open your preferred browser and browse to "localhost:8501". All done! You can start chatting!
